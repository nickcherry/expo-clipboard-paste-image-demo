# expo-clipboard paste image demo

Install dependencies by running `yarn install`, then start the iOS app by running `yarn ios`. Copy an image to the clipboard from another app, then return to the demo app and press the "Does clipboard have an image?" button.

See [./demo.mov](./demo.mov) for a pre-recorded demonstration of the problem.
